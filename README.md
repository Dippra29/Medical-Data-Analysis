   Author:Dipali V Agrawal  
  

## Overview  
This project presents an in-depth Power BI analysis of hospital data, offering insights into patient demographics, case types, and medical specialties. It features interactive visualizations and slicers to explore various aspects of hospital performance and patient trends.

## Key Features:
1.Data Models:  
   - Hospital Data Table:Contains information on patient cases, specialties, and age profiles.  
   - Mapping Specialty Table:Categorizes medical specialties.

2. Dashboard Highlights:  
   - Total Patients: 25 million patients analyzed.  
   - Average Patients: 54 per day/unit.  
   - Quarterly Insights: Regular and past patient data comparison.

3. Interactive Slicers: 
   Filter data by:  
   - Date range  
   - Case type (Day Case, Inpatient, Outpatient)  
   - Specialty group (Blood, Bones, Brain, etc.)  
   - Age profile (0-15, 16-64, 65+)

4. Visualizations: 
   - Stacked Column Charts: Analyze patient distribution by specialty and age group.  
   - Clustered Bar Charts: Compare age demographics across different specialties.  
   - Line Charts: Track case trends (Day Cases, Inpatients, Outpatients) from 2018 to 2021.  
   - Donut Chart: Displays adult (86%) vs. child (14%) patient distribution.

5. Data Tree:  
   A hierarchical view of patients by specialty, age group, and patient type, providing detailed breakdowns for specific years and months.

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
